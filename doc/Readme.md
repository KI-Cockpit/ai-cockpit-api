# AI Cockpit

## Introduction & Motivation

AI systems must ensure bias free data processing. Growing software system complexity makes it very hard even for expert observers, to understand decisions taken by modern software systems. Due to their stochastic nature AI algorithms add another layer of uncertainty. Despite the promising potential that these algorithms can add to the capabilities of software systems, measures needs to be taken, to keep humans in control.

Thus a two-fold API is proposed to guarantee human control. This API aims at being useful for any decision making system and hence is abstracting from individual – ever progressing – algorithms. The two function areas are centered around 
* decisions taken in software systems and  
* explain data processing and bias control.
